# RobotVision

Author: Davide Congiu

Project Valid for Machine Learning course 2020/2021

RobotVision implements classifier based on fine-tuning of AlexNet crafted on iCubWorld dataset.

ICubWorld dataset: https://robotology.github.io/iCubWorld/#icubworld-1-modal

For the project development pytorch and ML course notebooks have been used as inspiration:
* https://github.com/unica-ml/ml/blob/master/notebooks/lab05.ipynb
* https://github.com/unica-ml/ml/blob/master/notebooks/lab06.ipynb

* https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html

Many thanks to professor Battista Biggio for the support
